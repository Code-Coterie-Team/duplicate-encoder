The Duplicate Encoder is a solution to a coding challenge from CodeWars.
The objective of this exercise is to transform a given string into new string where each character is represented as follows:
"(" if the character appears only once in the original string.
")" if the character appears more than once in the original string.
This transformation is case-senstive ,meaning that uppercases and lowercase version of this same ltter are treated as identical
